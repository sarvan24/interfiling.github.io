# Interfiling Medical Exams for I-485 Process

<font color=red>**Disclaimer:** The information provided on this site is not a legal advice. There is no defined process for the interfiling. This site is created based on the feedback from immigration attorney, trackitt forum and Telegram groups.</font>


## Filing Process
- Complete medical and get sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon 
  - You need to send reports within 60 days to USCIS if you are filing with I-485. 
  - If you already filed I-485 then you can send within 2 year, 60 days rule don't apply here. See USCIS table on [this page](https://www.uscis.gov/policy-manual/volume-8-part-b-chapter-4). Also see [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0CIiX11Qrw) by immigration attorney Reddy.
  - Try to get two sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon, they may charge you some fees. One you can use for interfiling and other you can use in case if you get RFE. 
- Attach below required documents
- Send packet to USCIS. 
  - Use single packet for primary and derivative.
  - On USPS/FedEx/UPS envelope put Attn:I 693 medical interfile
  - Address should be what you have on your I485, if Emma gave you a non PO number, that is ok too, they both go to same location. (This is not applicable unless your application is transferred to another service center, in that case, go with what Emma tells you)
  - Sent using USPS if address is PO Box, use fedex/USPS if not a PO Box

## Documents Required
- Copy of I-797C, Notice of Action, Receipt of filing I-485
- Sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon
- Copy of COVID-19 vaccination record
- Copy of biometrics receipt (if your biometrics status is not updated)
- Copy of driver's license (specify state)
- Cover letter, see formats below (You can use one letter for each member or single letter for family. Trackitt users confirmed they both work!)
- Barcodes page (if they are not printed on cover letter), [see format here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/interfiling/interfiling.github.io/main/barcodes-letter.txt). 
 
**Notes:** 
- Some people sent cover letter without barcodes and their medical is attached to their case.  
- Some people also sent cover letter without barcodes and they attached separate barcodes page.
- and some people sent cover letter with barcodes on it and that also worked.
- You must put I-485 receipt number and A number on cover letter.

## FAQ
**Q:** Is there any Risks of interfiling?

**A:** There is virtually no risk in sending the i693 form without an RFE except that you may lose the doctor's fee if USCIS does not add it to your file. [ref](https://www.am22tech.com/medical-interfile-letter/)
##

**Q:** Can I interfile medical or do I need attorney for filing?

**A:** You can do it yourself. [See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0CIiX11Qrw) by immigration attorney Reddy
##

**Q:** Where I should send I-485 interfiling documents?

**A:** You should send to the address mentioned on your I-485 receipt. If address is PO Box then you can only use USPS. If you want to send using FedEx or UPS then send to the alternate address of service center. Also before sending documents check with EMMA where your case is currently in process, sometime they transfer cases to other service center or FO. 
##

**Q:** My PPD or blood test came positive for TB, what should I do?

**A:** This is normal for many Asian people so don't worry. Your doctor will advice for x-ray test which can show negative for TB. 
##

**Q:** I interfiled medical but now received RFE asking for the medical records, what should I do?

**A:** Respond to RFE and send them another sealed I-693 Medical Reports signed by the Civil Surgeon. You can get multiple medical reports from your doctor, they may charge some fees for this.
##

**Q:** Do USCIS send receipt notice after interfiling?

**A:** No. USCIS will not send receipt notice or any type of communication after they receive a medical record.
##

**Q:** How long it will take to attach medical record to my case?

**A:** Once USCIS receives your package, it may take 2-5 days, but again it totally depends on the processing service center. Some service centers may take more time.
##

**Q:** How I will know if my medical is attached to my case or not?

**A:** You may check by using EMMA chat or call USCIS. Contact number: +1-800-375-5283 and just say “infopass” to speak to an agent.
##

**Q:** Does calling USCIS multiple times have any affect on the case?

**A:** No, as per [these immigration attorneys](https://www.avvo.com/legal-answers/does-calling-uscis-multiple-times-have-any-affect--3773865.html). If your attorney suggests not to call USCIS then follow what they say.
