## FAQ
**Q:** Is there any Risks of interfiling?

##

**Q:** Can I interfile medical or do I need attorney for filing?

**A:** You can do it yourself. [See this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l0CIiX11Qrw) by immigration attorney Reddy
##

**Q:** Where I should send I-485 interfiling documents?

**A:** You should send to the address mentioned on your I-485 receipt. If address is PO Box then you can only use USPS.
